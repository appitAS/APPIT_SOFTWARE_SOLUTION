    para: `Enhance your desktop monitoring application with AI-powered analytics and security features to optimize productivity and ensure data protection. The system evaluates employee performance through continuous screenshots, activity logs, and app usage, while automatically identifying leave days from login patterns. It generates daily AI-based productivity scores with detailed insights, flags non-work activities, and detects potential data risks such as unauthorized file transfers or emails to personal addresses. Before logging off, users review and submit their daily analytics for managerial approval, promoting transparency and accountability.`,

    para: `Track Nexus offers intelligent Login/Logout Detection by logging employee session times to accurately monitor work hours. Any workday without login activity is automatically marked as “Leave,” excluding weekends and recognized company holidays, reducing the need for manual attendance tracking. The system also segments each workday into active, idle, and break periods by analyzing patterns of activity and inactivity. This detailed session segmentation provides valuable insights into work habits, helping managers identify productivity trends, ensure time is spent efficiently, and support employee well-being through balanced work schedules.`,

    title: "Continuous Screenshot & Activity Analysis",
    para: `Track Nexus features Automated Capture, enabling desktop screenshots to be taken at customizable intervals—typically every 1 to 5 minutes—during active user sessions. These screenshots are processed using advanced AI, including OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and image recognition, to accurately identify open applications, websites, and document types in real time. This allows for deeper insight into how work hours are utilized. The system also performs Timestamp Correlation, aligning each screenshot with activity logs to provide a precise timeline and contextual  understanding of user behavior.This layered approach not only enhances productivity tracking but also strengthens compliance monitoring, offering managers a clear and accountable view of daily work patterns without being overly intrusive.`,

  {
    title: "AI-Driven Productivity Scoring",
    para: `Track Nexus uses AI-based classification to categorize activities as productive, unproductive, or neutral, tailored to each employee’s role. Productivity weights are assigned based on task relevance, and an AI Score is calculated using: (∑ “Weighted Productive Activity Time”) ÷ “Total Logged-in Time” × 100. Daily reports include the AI Score, login/logout times, and a breakdown of productive, unproductive, and idle time. Brief AI-generated observations also highlight work patterns or any unusual activity, providing managers with actionable insights.`,

    title: "Detection of Non-Work Activities",
    para: `Track Nexus employs AI-powered flagging to detect and highlight activities or screenshots that fall outside an employee’s assigned responsibilities—such as accessing social media, streaming sites, or engaging in personal browsing during work hours. When non-work-related activity exceeds a predefined, configurable threshold, the system automatically generates alerts for managers, enabling timely intervention. Authorized users can then review these flagged instances through a centralized dashboard, with tools to annotate and comment for documentation or follow-up action. This process not only reinforces accountability but also supports compliance and performance management by identifying recurring patterns and allowing for corrective measures when needed.`,

    title: "Data Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Leakage Prevention",
    para: `Track Nexus enhances data security by monitoring outgoing emails and file transfers for potential confidentiality risks. It flags and reports when official emails are sent to personal addresses (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo), or when sensitive files are transferred to USB drives, external storage, or attached to emails sent outside the organization. All incidents are logged with details such as user, device, timestamp, and file information. Real-time alerts notify designated managers or security teams, while flagged events are included in daily or weekly reports with export options. Authorized personnel can review, annotate, and take corrective action, and policy enforcement options allow for blocking or quarantining files or emails that breach data transfer rules.`,

  {
    title: "User Analytics Review and Submission",
    para: `Track Nexus includes a mandatory end-of-day review, requiring users to go through a summary of their daily activity before logging off. This summary includes login/logout times, AI productivity scores, key applications and websites used, flagged non-work activities, and any data privacy incidents. Users must submit the reviewed report for managerial approval. Managers then verify the report for accuracy and compliance, with options to approve or request clarifications. All submissions and approvals are logged to maintain a clear audit trail, ensuring transparency and accountability. This process encourages self-awareness among employees and promotes consistent alignment with organizational policies. It also helps managers identify patterns early and provide timely support or intervention when needed.`,

  {
    title: "Reporting and Data Export",
    para: `Track Nexus offers automated day-wise and summary productivity reports that include key metrics such as leave status, AI Score, flagged non-work activities, and any data privacy or confidentiality incidents. These reports provide a comprehensive view of employee performance and compliance. For easy review and documentation, the system supports data export in PDF and CSV formats, enabling seamless integration with internal reporting and audit processes.`,

  {
    title: "Privacy and Access Controls",
    para: `Track Nexus implements robust role-based access controls to protect sensitive information and maintain organizational security. Access to critical data such as screenshots, flagged activities, email alerts, data transfer logs, and analytics submissions is strictly limited to authorized personnel, such as managers and system administrators. This ensures that only relevant roles can view or act on sensitive insights, reducing the risk of misuse or unauthorized exposure. In addition, all monitoring activities and data handling processes are designed to comply with company privacy policies and adhere to relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR or HIPAA. This approach not only safeguards employee privacy but also helps organizations maintain compliance, build trust, and uphold ethical monitoring standards.`,
